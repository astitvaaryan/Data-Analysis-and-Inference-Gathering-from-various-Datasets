# Data Analysis and Insights on Various Datasets

This repository features data narratives created for the Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization course. The project involves analyzing three different datasets using Python to uncover patterns and insights. It highlights skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistics, utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Project Highlights
Each folder contains the Python scripts used for data visualization and processing, along with analysis reports featuring visualized graphs and derived insights.
